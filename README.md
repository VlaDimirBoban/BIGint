# BIGint
Daily c++ pracitce this time consiting of a custom infinte integer type implemented along with 4 basic operations.
Might implement few extra operations.

Update:

- % modulus
- ^ raise to the power
- SQRT 
- int to BIGint conversion

Probably maybe this is the best BIGint implementation in the history in the world. Amen.


Bobi forever
